/*
Algorithm

This solution is based upon Rejection Sampling. The main idea is when you generate,
a number in the desired range,
output that number immediately.
If the number is out of the desired range, reject it and re-sample again.
As each number in the desired range has the same probability of being chosen,
a uniform distribution is produced.

Obviously, we have to run rand7() function at least twice,
as there are not enough numbers in the range of 1 to 10.
By running rand7() twice, we can get integers from 1 to 49 uniformly. Why?


rejectionSamplingTable
A table is used to illustrate the concept of rejection sampling.
Calling rand7() twice will get us row and column index that corresponds,
to a unique position in the table above.
Imagine that you are choosing a number randomly from the table above. I
f you hit a number, you return that number immediately.
If you hit a * , you repeat the process again until you hit a number.

Since 49 is not a multiple of 10, we have to use rejection sampling.
Our desired range is integers from 1 to 40, which we can return the answer immediately.
If not (the integer falls between 41 to 49),
we reject it and repeat the whole process again.
